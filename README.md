# Technical Language Processing Community of Interest

Governance, contribution guidance, and project-planning documentation for the TLP Community of Interest.

> *The Technical Language Processing Community of Interest (TLP-COI) GitHub organization and associated pages have been created to enable open scientific and technical communication. While this group was established and is managed by the development team at NIST, we intend for this to be an open forum for multi-directional communication between all involved in the community, and not just between users and developers. NIST participants will reply when it is appropriate for them to do so, and may limit their participation in some topics when it is not. For example, NIST will not provide advice or comment on any matter that is or may be the subject of a legal proceeding.*
